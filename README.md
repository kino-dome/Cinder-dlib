# Cinder-dlib

A [dlib](http://dlib.net "dlib") bridge for [Cinder](http://www.libcinder.org "Cinder")


### Description
Very much inspired by [ofxDlib](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxDlib/tree/masterhttp:// "ofxDlib"). Using the generic_image.h interface, the conversions between dlib and Cinder are made toll-free, meanining no extra process is done and images are just interpreted into the target formats.

### Installation
dlib needs to be built and placed in the `lib` folder. There are helper scripts in the `install` folder.
